      <h1>Code4Covid</h1>
      
      <p class='intro'>The <b>COVID19 Tech Response</b> group is a coalition of groups in the tech community coming together to solve problems related to the current crisis.</p>
      
      <p class='intro'><i>Our aim is that no one should needlessly be put at risk because they didn't have access to technology that a volunteer technologist could have made. We have started to do this by aggregating both the people who want to help, and the problems they could be used to solve.</i></p>
      
      <h4>There are two ways to get involved</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrijsXl5oUozCq0p">Join our community</a> of over 400 technologists. Our members have backgrounds working at companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft and come with experience in web development, design, project management, IT and more.</li>
        <li>Share <a href="https://covidtechsupport.com">Covid Tech Support</a> with anyone who may need technical help during this crisis.</li>
      </ul>
      
       <p class='intro'>It is early days (and this website is under development) but we are exploring how we can improve the ‘matching’ of these volunteers and projects. For now, the Slack community is already coming together to swap resources, build projects and help those in need, and we don’t want to slow that down.</p>
         
          <p class='intro'>There are many efforts going on around the wider community. We encourage everyone to visit the library of resources at the <a href="http://coronavirustechhandbook.com/">Coronavirus Tech Handbook</a> to learn more.</p>
