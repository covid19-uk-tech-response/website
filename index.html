      <p class='intro'>The <b>COVID19 Tech Response</b> group is a coalition of groups in the tech community coming together to solve problems related to the current crisis.</p>
      
      <p class='intro'><i>Our aim is that no one should needlessly be put at risk because they didn't have access to technology that a volunteer technologist could have made. We have started to do this by aggregating both the people who want to help, and the problems they could be used to solve.</i></p>
      
      <h4>There are two ways to get involved</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Join our community <link to the airtable>of over 400 technologists. Our members have backgrounds working at companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft and come with experience in web development, design, project management, IT and more.</li>
        <li>Share <a href="https://covidtechsupport.com">Covid Tech Support</a> with anyone who may need technical help during this crisis.</li>
      </ul>
      
       <p class='intro'>It is early days (and this website is under development) but we are exploring how we can improve the ‘matching’ of these volunteers and projects. For now, the Slack community is already coming together to swap resources, build projects and help those in need, and we don’t want to slow that down.</p>
         
          <p class='intro'>There are many efforts going on around the wider community. We encourage everyone to visit the library of resources at the <a href="http://coronavirustechhandbook.com/">Coronavirus Tech Handbook</a> to learn more.</p>
      
      <hl>
      
         
      <p class='intro'>The <b>COVID19 Tech Response</b> team's mission is to find technology solutions to problems that will arise due to the COVID-19 crisis. We believe that technology can minimise the disruption caused by the pandemic and ultimately save lives.</p>

      <p class='intro'>Our aim is that no one should needlessly be put at risk because they didn't have access to technology that a volunteer technologist could have made.</p>

      <h4>About COVID19 Tech Response</h4>

      <p>The COVID19 pandemic is the largest and most dangerous viral pandemic since the 'Spanish Flu' in 1918, which killed 20-50m people. Currently, to minimise casualties, COVID19 is being tackled on two fronts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Treating the virus using medical advances led by scientists, doctors and researchers.</li>
        <li>Slowing down the virus using social engineering led by governments and local communities.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Unlike our ancestors with 'Spanish Flu', we have a century of new technologies to help us minimise casualties. However, those on the 'front line' of tackling COVID19 are not generally technologists and may not know how technology can help them.</p>

      <p>There are already lots of ongoing efforts to use tech to help in this crisis. These include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/'>coronavirustechhandbook.com</a> - COVID19 Tech Response's library of resources</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://covidmutualaid.org/'>covidmutualaid.org</a> - A direct line into local community efforts</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://corona-emergency.slack.com'>Covid-Emergency</a> and <a href='https://techforuk.com/'>TechForUK</a> - Slack groups for collecting volunteers and open discussion</li>
        <li><a href='https://www.covid19-response.com/'>covid19-response.com</a> - Moderated scientific 'request for ideas'</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://helpwithcovid.com/'>helpwithcovid.com</a> - International volunteer sign ups and ideas board</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>COVID19 Tech Response's aim is not to build the individual solutions needed by those on the front line. Instead, it is a steering group that provides the broad oversight that connects these individual efforts together, and to put in place the system that enables new problems to be solved efficiently and effectively using technology.</b></p>
