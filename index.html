      <p class='intro'>The <b>COVID19 Tech Response</b> team's mission is to find technology solutions to problems that will arise due to the COVID-19 crisis. We believe that technology can minimise the disruption caused by the pandemic and ultimately save lives.</p>

      <p class='intro'>Our aim is that no one should needlessly be put at risk because they didn't have access to technology that a volunteer technologist could have made.</p>

      <h4>About COVID19 Tech Response</h4>

      <p>The COVID19 pandemic is the largest and most dangerous viral pandemic since the 'Spanish Flu' in 1918, which killed 20-50m people. Currently, to minimise casualties, COVID19 is being tackled on two fronts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Treating the virus using medical advances led by scientists, doctors and researchers.</li>
        <li>Slowing down the virus using social engineering led by governments and local communities.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Unlike our ancestors with 'Spanish Flu', we have a century of new technologies to help us minimise casualties. However, those on the 'front line' of tackling COVID19 are not generally technologists and may not know how technology can help them.</p>

      <p>There are already lots of ongoing efforts to use tech to help in this crisis. These include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/'>coronavirustechhandbook.com</a> - COVID19 Tech Response's library of resources</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://covidmutualaid.org/'>covidmutualaid.org</a> - A direct line into local community efforts</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://corona-emergency.slack.com'>Covid-Emergency</a> and <a href='https://techforuk.com/'>TechForUK</a> - Slack groups for collecting volunteers and open discussion</li>
        <li><a href='https://www.covid19-response.com/'>covid19-response.com</a> - Moderated scientific 'request for ideas'</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://helpwithcovid.com/'>helpwithcovid.com</a> - International volunteer sign ups and ideas board</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>COVID19 Tech Response's aim is not to build the individual solutions needed by those on the front line. Instead, it is a steering group that provides the broad oversight that connects these individual efforts together, and to put in place the system that enables new problems to be solved efficiently and effectively using technology.</b></p>
